Python bindings to the Designate API
=====================================

This is a client library for Designate built on the Designate API. It
provides a Python API (the ``designateclient`` module) and a command-line tool
(``designate``).

Development takes place via the usual OpenStack processes as outlined in the
`developer guide <http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html>`_.  The master
repository is in `Git <http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/python-designateclient>`_.

See release notes and more at `<http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-designateclient/>`_.
